# Grinder

> Grinder (noun): a player that populates the lower lines or lower pairings. Has hands of stone, but is physical and works hard when heâ€™s out on the ice. Usually beloved by the rest of the team.

Grinder is a Go based framework with the aim of making the development of microservices easier. It attempts to do all the hard work / heaving lifting, hence why we called it Grinder, so that you can focus on your service.

## Example
```go
func main() {
	svc := grinder.New()

	// index handler
	svc.GET("/", func(ctx grinder.Context) error {
		return c.String(200, "Legs feed the wolf")
	})

	svc.Start()
}
```
